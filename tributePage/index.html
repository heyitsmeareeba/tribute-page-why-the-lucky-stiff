                <h1> BIOGRAPHY</h1>
            <h2>_Why THE LUCKY STIFF</h2>
            <p>Jonathan Gillette, known by the pseudonym why the lucky stiff (often abbreviated as _why), is a writer, cartoonist, artist, and programmer notable for his work with the Ruby programming language. Annie Lowrey described him as "one of the most unusual, and beloved, computer programmers" in the world.[1] Along with Yukihiro Matsumoto and David Heinemeier Hansson, he was seen as one of the key figures in the Ruby community.[2] His pseudonym might allude to the exclamation "Why, the lucky stiff!" from The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.[1]
</p><p>_why made a presentation enigmatically titled "A Starry Afternoon, a Sinking Symphony, and the Polo Champ Who Gave It All Up for No Reason Whatsoever" at the 2005 O'Reilly Open Source Convention.[1] It explored how to teach programming and make the subject more appealing to adolescents. _why gave a presentation and performed with his band, the Thirsty Cups, at RailsConf in 2006</p>

        On 19 August 2009, _why's accounts on Twitter and GitHub and his personally maintained websites went offline.[1][5] Shortly before he disappeared, _why tweeted, "programming is rather thankless. u see your works become replaced by superior ones in a year. unable to run at all in a few more."[5]
        </p><p>
        _why's colleagues have assembled collections of his writings and projects.[6][7][8]
       </p> <p>
        In 2012, his website briefly went back online with a detailed explanation of his plans for the future.</p>
